Dear %%first_name%%,

I am excited to share with you the release of the all-new K–5 Voyager Passport 2020 launching this summer. Voyager Passport classic was used throughout elementary schools in Clark County for intervention and achieved strong results.

Voyager Passport supports all state standards and has the highest level of ESSA research available, achieving a rating of “Strong” or Level 1.

Voyager Passport 2020 includes:

- Exciting travel theme
- New writing activities
- Extended lessons
- eBooks

Updated passage topics that align to science, social studies, and the arts to learn more about the new and exciting Voyager Passport K–5 solution. I look forward to sharing it and being part of your students’ success.
